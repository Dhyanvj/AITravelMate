# AI Travel Mate üß≥‚úàÔ∏è

An intelligent travel companion app built with React Native and Expo, featuring AI-powered trip planning and travel assistance.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI Travel Assistant**: Get personalized travel advice and recommendations
- üì± **Modern UI**: Beautiful, animated interface with smooth transitions
- üéØ **Smart Recommendations**: Get suggestions based on your preferences and location

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI API (Optional)

For full AI functionality, you'll need an OpenAI API key:

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

**Note**: The app works without an API key using fallback responses, but you'll get better AI-powered recommendations with a valid key.

### 3. Start the App

```bash
npx expo start
```

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
